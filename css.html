<h1 id="id1">Agriculture</h1>
<p>The practice of agriculture is also known as "farming", while scientists, inventors and others devoted to improving farming methods and implements are also said to be engaged in agriculture.

Subsistence farming, who farms a small area with limited resource inputs, and produces only enough food to meet the needs of his/her family.

At the other end is commercial intensive agriculture, including industrial agriculture.

Such farming involves large fields and/or numbers of animals, large resource inputs (pesticides, fertilizers, etc.), and a high level of mechanization.

These operations generally attempt to maximize financial income from grain, produce, or livestock.

Modern agriculture extends well beyond the traditional production of food for humans and animal feeds.</p>
<h2>Etymology and scope</h2>
<h1>Origins</h1>
<p>The development of agriculture enabled the human population to grow many times larger than could be sustained by hunting and gathering.[7] Agriculture began independently in different parts of the globe, and included a diverse range of taxa, in at least 11 separate centres of origin.[5] Wild grains were collected and eaten from at least 105,000 years ago.[8] From around 11,500 years ago, the eight Neolithic founder crops, emmer and einkorn wheat, hulled barley, peas, lentils, bitter vetch, chick peas and flax were cultivated in the Levant. Rice was domesticated in China between 11,500 and 6,200 BC with the earliest known cultivation from 5,700 BC,[9] followed by mung, soy and azuki beans. Sheep were domesticated in Mesopotamia between 13,000 and 11,000 years ago.[10] Cattle were domesticated from the wild aurochs in the areas of modern Turkey and Pakistan some 10,500 years ago.[11] Pig production emerged in Eurasia, including Europe, East Asia and Southwest Asia,[12] where wild boar were first domesticated about 10,500 years ago.[13] In the Andes of South America,</p>
<h1>Civilizations</h1>
<p>n Eurasia, the Sumerians started to live in villages from about 8,000 BC, relying on the Tigris and Euphrates rivers and a canal system for irrigation. Ploughs appear in pictographs around 3,000 BC; seed-ploughs around 2,300 BC. Farmers grew wheat, barley, vegetables such as lentils and onions, and fruits including dates, grapes, and figs.[19] Ancient Egyptian agriculture relied on the Nile River and its seasonal flooding. Farming started in the predynastic period at the end of the Paleolithic, after 10,000 BC. Staple food crops were grains such as wheat and barley, alongside industrial crops such as flax and papyrus.[20][21] In India, wheat, barley and jujube were domesticated by 9,000 BC, soon followed by sheep and goats.[22] Cattle, sheep and goats were domesticated in Mehrgarh culture by 8,000â€“6,000 BC.[23][24][24][25] Cotton was cultivated by the 5</p>
